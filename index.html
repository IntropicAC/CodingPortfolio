        <p>
          Hello, I'm Alex, a passionate and dedicated individual on a journey to
          become a part of the IT space. At <span id="age"></span> years old,
          I've spent my time immersing myself in the world of coding, constantly
          pushing myself to learn and grow in this exciting field. Currently, I
          work as a Security Lead on a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)
          ward, where I am responsible for creating and implementing training
          plans designed to ensure the safety of both staff and patients. In
          this role, I have developed a standardized training pack that helps
          unify staff training across the ward, ensuring consistency and clarity
          in all procedures. I also create training materials and implement them
          in accordance with my manager’s directives, addressing the specific
          needs of the ward. This position has deepened my leadership,
          problem-solving, and communication skills as I work closely with the
          team to improve safety standards. <br /><br />My experience in
          healthcare, combined with my new responsibilities, has taught me
          valuable lessons in risk management, crisis intervention, and the
          importance of clear, effective communication under pressure. This
          experience has further enhanced my organizational skills, allowing me
          to coordinate action plans that directly contribute to a safer
          environment for all. Before stepping into this role, I worked as a
          Senior Healthcare Assistant in the same psychiatric hospital, where I
          gained essential experience in providing compassionate care. My time
          in healthcare has not only strengthened my interpersonal skills but
          has also given me the ability to handle high-pressure situations
          calmly and effectively—qualities. I hold a 2:1 degree in psychology,
          which deepened my understanding of human behavior and cognition,
          enabling me to approach IT with a unique perspective. <br /><br />
          I am drawn to the ever-evolving nature of the tech
          field, always seeking to stay updated with the latest technologies and
          industry best practices. With a solid foundation in coding, hands-on
          experience in creating training systems, and a genuine passion IT, I
          am now actively seeking opportunities to transition into this exciting
          sector. I am eager to contribute my skills, creativity, and drive to
          create a better work enviroment.
